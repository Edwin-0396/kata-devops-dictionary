# Kata DevOps Dictionary

This project takes a simple Python kata — a `Dictionary` class with basic lookup and add methods — and demonstrates how it can be elevated into a complete DevOps lifecycle. The code is tested and containerized with Docker, deployed to Kubernetes, and provisioned with Terraform for reproducibility. Delivery is automated through GitHub Actions (CI/CD) and GitOps with ArgoCD. Security practices are integrated through DevSecOps scans (Bandit, Trivy, Checkov) and Vault for secret management. Observability is enabled with Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards, while the repo structure follows Platform Engineering principles, making it reusable and template-ready. Extensions include simple AIOps-driven anomaly detection on metrics/logs, and SRE practices such as SLOs, SLIs, and error budgets.  

This repository shows how even the smallest application can be delivered, secured, and scaled through the most advanced stack in DevOps today: **Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Docker, Prometheus, Vault, Ansible, and Pulumi** — all applied with the mindset of **DevSecOps, Observability, Platform Engineering, AIOps, and SRE**. It reflects a forward-focused approach to building reliable, intelligent, and adaptive systems.
